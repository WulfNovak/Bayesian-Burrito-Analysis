# Bayesian-Burrito-Analysis
Used both the MCMC algorithm and Block Gibbs to assess the effects of hunger and cost on overall burrito rating.

The rmd file shows the code used for the analysis.
The PDF file shows the slideshow in an unideal non-html format. 
The html file gives code featuring the following slides: 
* Research Question
* Data Processing
* The Model Used
* Diagnostics (Convergence and the Auto Correlation Function Effects)
* Results
* Conclusion

NOT INCLUDED in the slideshow are the following observations: 
* The model converges satisfactorily - this is indicated by the estimates not jumping around sporadically.
* We have a very small ACF - this accents the accuracy of our model.
